# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## TheySaidSo.com  $5/mo  Quotes

A Database of quotes! Authors, Politicians, all around great minds...  If You like quotes this is a great resource.



## TheySaidSo.com/api

They self describe as the "Greatest Quotes Api on Earth", but I don't really care about that. Their documentation is excellent and this api is extremely easy to work with.  There are a lot of search parameters you can include too like length and data type.
	I recommend it for anyone who wants an API that won't make their projects harder to complete -- which I appreciate even more now that I got to see how people truly struggled with crappy api's.

Downside is it cost $5 / mo if you make more than 10 pulls a day.
