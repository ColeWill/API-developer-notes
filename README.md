# External API Developer Notes

Here at GA we have compiled notes from our developer students about the APIs they have used.  Hopefully these notes will help guide you in your work with external APIs.

## General

This is where general API notes/advice will go.

## Co Trails

For this app I used the api "TrailAPI" from the site Mashape. While this api includes alot about trails around the world, it needs the npm library 'unirest' to function. There is documentation on unirest through npmjs.com, however its very exensive and time consuming to learn how to use it in 5 days. I also searched for tutorials on using unirest while buildiung restful routes and found one guy who was using Angular. Try not to use unirest.

## PetFinder

Easy to use API that returns data in JSON or XML depending on preference. The documentation provides you with ample descriptions of how to receive the type of data you want to and lets you hone in on specifics like age, location, breed, type of animal, etc. The data comes back with all the information you could possibly want to know about each animal along with image links, contact information and detailed descriptions.

The documentation provides you with examples of the routes you'll need to use to get back the information you want.

APIs don't need to be ruff.

## ShopStyle API

ShopStyle is a great API for anyone that wants to access multiple retailers & clothing items all from one source.  Some examples are Nordstrom, Shopbop, etc.  The API returns JSON and is pretty straightforward but has a LOT of information to sort through so it's a great idea to think through your specific goals before diving in.  Getting the key is pretty easy, all you have to do is create an account through ShopStyle and they generate an API key that you can access through your account settings.  Here is a link to the API overview with directions:

## Mashape

This API library has a lot of great api's to choose from along with great documentation. The only problem is that Mashape uses the unirest library for the requests, which we haven't covered yet. Besides the unirest issue, Mashape is a great place to find an api. 

Mashape's documentation comes along with examples for each request which is nice. Also Mashape provides the endpoints to test in PostMan which is very helpful.

## GOOGLE MAPS API

by alex:
highly recommend this api, great instructions online and lots of room for expansion and personalization. just takes a second to get used to their 'specific' commands, in this sense reading the documentation is essential otherwise you might be banging your head against the wall like "WHY CAN'T I GET THE LATITUDE WHEN I'M SAYIN .LAT", because it's not quite as simple as that. Like I said, highly recommend. 10/10 would use again.
